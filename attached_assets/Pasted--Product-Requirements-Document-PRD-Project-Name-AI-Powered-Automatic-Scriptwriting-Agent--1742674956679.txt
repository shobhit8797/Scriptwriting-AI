# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name
AI-Powered Automatic Scriptwriting Agent

## Overview
The AI-Powered Automatic Scriptwriting Agent is designed to automate the process of generating YouTube scripts. The system will take user-defined instructions and iteratively refine AI-generated content to reduce redundancy and enhance quality. The final output will be exported in a structured document format.

## Objectives
- Automate YouTube script generation through multiple AI iterations.
- Improve content coherence and minimize repetition.
- Allow user customization and prompt refinement.
- Export final scripts into Google Docs or Word format.
- Provide an intuitive UI using ShadCN components.

## Functional Requirements
### 1. User Input & Configuration
- Users can provide initial instructions and script structure.
- Option to select from multiple AI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Grok).
- Adjustable parameters for tone, style, and length.

### 2. AI-Powered Script Generation
- The system generates an initial script based on user input.
- AI refines the script across 3â€“4 iterations to enhance quality.
- Redundancy detection and content variation applied during revisions.

### 3. Script Review & Editing
- Users can preview each iteration and make manual adjustments if needed.
- Option to accept or request further refinements before finalizing.

### 4. Export Functionality
- Final script can be exported to Google Docs or Word format.
- Clean formatting and proper document structure ensured.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The system should be responsive and accessible across devices.
- Minimal latency during AI interactions and script generation.
- Secure authentication for user settings and preferences.
- UI designed with ShadCN for a modern and minimalistic experience.

## User Interface & Experience
- Clean and intuitive interface with ShadCN components.
- Clear navigation for input, iterations, and export options.
- Status indicators for processing and AI iterations.

## Future Enhancements
- Multi-language support for script generation.
- Integration with video editing tools.
- API access for automated script requests.

## Assumptions & Constraints
- The AI models will be accessed via third-party APIs.
- Users should provide well-structured initial prompts for optimal results.
- The system will not handle video generation, only scriptwriting.
